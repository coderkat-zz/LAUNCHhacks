Welcome to RubberDuck!

The first iteration of this project was built in 48 hours as a part of
a hackathon in the fall of 2013.

The idea was borne of Kat's time learning to code in coffee shops. She could
see other people writing code around her (hi, San Francisco!), but didn't 
have anyone she could ask her questions to when she got stuck.

Rubber Duck allows individuals to both give help and ask for it in 
real space and time! We use Firebase, Foursquare and Twilio's API 
to connect users in the real world.
